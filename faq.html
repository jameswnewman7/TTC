      <h5>What kind of trips are there?</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Hiking, Camping, Backpacking, Rock Climbing, Caving, Kayaking, Mountain Biking, Skiing, Trail Maintenace, etc.</p>
	  <h5>Can I lead my own trips?</h5>
	  <p class="w3-text-grey">Absolutly! This is a student led organization so most of our trip leaders are students. However you have to get trip leader certified by TTC. Talk to our Safety and Compliance Officer to learn more about the process and apprentice under one of our current trip leaders in order to get certified.</p>
	  <h5>What if I don't have any experience?</h5>
	  <p class="w3-text-grey">Good! We have beginners all the time and as long as you're curious/excited, we'll make sure that you'll learn the necessary skills. 
	  <h5>I don't have a sleeping bag or any gear. Should I buy them beforehand?</h5>
	  <p class="w3-text-grey">You can buy them beforehand but it is not necessary at all. We have a huge storage locker off campus that has all the gear you'll need for the trip. Just let your trip leader know beforehand.</p>
	  <h5>Are there trips going out every week.</h5>
	  <p class="w3-text-grey">Pretty much every week. It ultimatly depends on the trip leaders and if they have trips going out. However we usually have at least one trip and oftentimes multiple trips every week.</p>
	  <h5>What if I hate nature?</h5>
	  <p class="w3-text-grey">Join us on our Trail Maintenace Trips! You'll be spending your time bashing rocks and tearing up the ground. You can contribute to trails that'll stick it to Mother Nature for generations to come.</p>
	  <h5>When are trips?</h5>
	  <p class="w3-text-grey">They are pretty much always on the weekends however some hooligans skip class and do it on the weekdays.</p>
	  <h5>How do I become a officer</h5>
	  <p class="w3-text-grey">We hold elections at the end of every Fall Semester and positions are for a full calender year. Positions include President, Vice President, Gear Manager(2), Secretary, Intro Trip Coordinator, Saftey and Compliance, Trail Maintenace(2), and Director of Outreach
	  <h5>Where do you go on trips?</h5>
	  <p class="w3-text-grey">We mostly go to Maryland, Virgina, West Virgina and Pennsylvaina though it varies. We also go on longer, more exotic trips during holidays/Spring Break to places like Utah and Georgia.</p> 
	  <h5>What is a fun fact about TTC</h5>
	  <p class="w3-text-grey">We are the oldest club on campus!</p>
	  <h5>How long are meetings?</h5>
	  <p class="w3-text-grey">Usually around 20-45 minutes.</p>
	  <h5>What if I can't make the meetings?</h5>
	  <p class="w3-text-grey">It's totally fine. Obviously we would love everyone in TTC to come however it is not a requirement.</p>
	  <h5>Does TTC sell any merchandise?</h5>
	  <p class="w3-text-grey">Yes we do. We currently have patches and socks on sale. Also we have t-shirts and long sleeves however there is a limted quantity.</p>
